This is a coding sandbox app for practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a live enviornment without a full IDE or code editor.
Practice coding on the go or try things out before committing.

The HTML field allows emmet autocomplete on TAB press. eg: div and then TAB will output <div></div>. Same for all other common HTML tags.
Input values are saved in local storage, so no worried if you leave the page and come back, your data will still be there.
